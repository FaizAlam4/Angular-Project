It is frontend prototype only. Designed from scratch by me with the purpose of learning angular 
from its syntax to other functionalities it offers. 


## There are several endpoints:

1. /about -> Tells about me

2. /login -> Opens login page made with angular forms (It is not accepting data as there is no backend)
   
   
3. /signup -> Shows register page

4. /feature ->  A random section which might not be so relevant in bigger picture but it is made just with
                the purpose of understanding how data is shared among components in angular.
                There is a field where one can register any title with description and it will be displayed
                on screen immediately when you click 'add information'(this is added with a todo reference)
